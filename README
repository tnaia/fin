*FIN: The command line personal finances manager*

Keeping track of personal finances is an incredibly boring task, and if you don't have much money then juggling it can be tricky.  When looking at the existing software out there to manage accounts it's frequently highly complex and top heavy.  Fin - an abbreviation of "financials" - is an attempt to do the opposite of what most accounting software does, and that's to make things incredibly simple and quick.  Logging a transaction or viewing your current balance should take no more than a few seconds.  This means less time wasted on bureaucracy and more time spent on what you really want to be doing.

* _Installation_

The easiest way to install is via a pre-compiled package.  You can also compile from source as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev bcrypt gnuplot
    make
    sudo make install
#+END_SRC

You will need to have the sqlite3 development package installed to be able to compile, and to get the full functionality you'll also need to have gnuplot and bcrypt installed.


* _Language_

First set the language:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin language "English US"

   fin language "English UK"
#+END_SRC

Possible languages are: English UK, English US, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Russian, Polish, Dutch, Chinese

Currently only English UK and English US are implemented.  For translation text see international.c


* _Basic Usage_

To log an amount of money spent:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin spend <amount> on <thing purchased>

   fin spend 2.99 on cheese

   fin spend 4.50 date 02/07/2011 on bread
#+END_SRC

Currency symbols such as $ or £ should not be included in the amount.

You might also wish to log where money was spent, so that you can use that as a search criteria later.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin spend 25.39 on groceries at supermarket
#+END_SRC

To receive an amount of money:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin receive <amount> from <source>

   fin receive 100 from "balance brought forward"
#+END_SRC

To show recent transactions just type "fin".  The most recent is at the top.  If you want to list more transactions:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin transactions <number>
#+END_SRC

You can also see aggregated figures:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin monthly

   fin yearly
#+END_SRC

and combine these to view however many transactions you want:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin monthly transactions 24
#+END_SRC

You can also use the word 'records' instead of 'transactions'.

By default transactions will be timestamped according to the system time when they are entered.  Optionally it is possible to adjust the time using the *time* option.  For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin receive 2.50 from "back of sofa" time 3.45pm
#+END_SRC


* _Brief Status Messages_

It's also possible to produce brief status messages suitable either for including into *.bashrc* files, or for sending to a text-to-speech system.

** Balance

To report the balance for the currently selected account.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  fin say

  fin say | espeak
#+END_SRC

** Average Income

To see what your average income has been over the previous year.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  fin say income

  fin say income | espeak
#+END_SRC

** Average Spending

To see what your average spending rate has been over the previous year.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  fin say spending

  fin say spend | espeak
#+END_SRC

The spending status message will also provide an estimate of when your funds will run out, or if the balance is negative how long it will take to pay off the debt or overdraft at the current average rate of income and spending.  This can help to provide an indication of whether your current rate of income and spending are sustainable or not, based upon the previous years transactions.  If you want to improve this time estimate you can also include average inflation and interest rates.

So for example in the case of a savings account where the balance is positive.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  fin say spend interest 1.5 inflation 2.0
#+END_SRC

Sets an average savings interest rate of 1.5% per year and an average inflation rate of 2% per year.  Or for a current account which is overdrawn and has a usury rate (APR) of 18%.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  fin say spend apr 18 inflation 2.0

  fin say spending usury 18 inflation 2.0 | espeak
#+END_SRC

** Personal Inflation Rate

Indepentently from national inflation rates you can also get an idea of your own personal inflation rate.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  fin say inflation

  fin say inflation | espeak
#+END_SRC

This compares spending within the previous three months with the same three months a year ago, and will report the percentage by which these values have changed.


* _Searching_

To search for transactions with particular words:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin find <words>
#+END_SRC

Note that multiple words should be surrounded by quotes, such as:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin find "cheese sandwich"
#+END_SRC

You can also use wildcards:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin find "*cheese*"
#+END_SRC

Or with multiple strings:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin find "cheese, bread, butter"
#+END_SRC

It's also possible to search by months or years:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin find "*" month jan
   fin find "*" year 2011
#+END_SRC

As an alternative to "find" you can also use the word "search".

You can also aggregate figures on a monthly basis.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin find "*groceries*" monthly
#+END_SRC


* _Deleting transactions_

To delete a transaction first locate the record number on the far left hand side by typing "fin" or doing a search, then type:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin undo <record number>
#+END_SRC


* _Editing transactions_

The status or description for a transaction can be edited as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin edit <record number> status <new status> description <new description>

   fin edit 2 status "complete"

   fin edit 3 description "groceries"

   fin edit 1 date "15/08/2016"
#+END_SRC

The record number is the number shown to the far left when you type "fin" or do a search.  If you wish to change the date or values then use the undo command and create a new transaction.

All edits are recorded, and can be viewed by typing:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  fin edits
#+END_SRC

So if you make a change by mistake it's always possible to see what the previous values were.  The letter on the left hand side indicates different types of edit.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  B    The state of the transaction before the edit was made

  A    The state of the transaction after the edit was made

  D    A deleted transaction
#+END_SRC

If necessary you can also search through the edits.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  fin edits search "*cheese*"

  fin edits search "*" year 2012

  fin edits search "*" month dec
#+END_SRC


* _Multiple Accounts_

By default any transactions will be added to an account called "current".

To create other accounts, or to switch to another account use the following

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin account <name>
#+END_SRC

For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin account savings
   fin account expenses
#+END_SRC

All account data is stored in the directory called ".fin" in your home directory (~/.fin).

Or just to send a particular transaction to a particular account:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin spend 2.99 on chips account:expenses
#+END_SRC


* _Transfering between accounts_

To transfer an ammount from one account to another:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin transfer <amount> to <account name>
#+END_SRC

For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin transfer 10.29 to savings
#+END_SRC

This will transfer 10.29 from whatever is the currently active account (you can check that by typing "fin") to the savings account.


* _Synchronising across multiple machines_

Often people use more than one computer, and want to be able to transfer data.  Fin does this using the scp command, in order to push or pull data from an ssh server.

To push the data to a server:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin push <domain>:<directory>

   fin push mydomainname.com:/home/myusername
#+END_SRC

Optionally you can also include the username for the remote system if it differs from your local username.  If you get a /"permission denied"/ message when attempting to push or pull then try one of the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin username <myusername> push mydomainname.com:/home/myusername

   fin username <myusername> pull mydomainname.com:/home/myusername
#+END_SRC


Subsequently you can then just type:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin push
#+END_SRC

The same also applies to retrieve data from a server:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   fin pull
#+END_SRC


* _Changing currencies_

It's possible to log amounts in multiple currencies, for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    fin spend 3.40 on milk curr:EUR
#+END_SRC

means that the amount spent was in Euros.  Currencies are always given as a three character code (GBP, USD, BTC, etc).

You can also change the default currency:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    fin currency USD
#+END_SRC

with any subsequent transactions then occurring in that currency by default.


* _Importing data_

** From CSV

Data can be imported from a CSV file, which is a common way of exporting bank transactions from online accounts.  The first line of the file is assumed to be a header containing field names.

The expected field names are "Date", "Money in", "Money out", "Spent", "Spend", "Amount", "Memo", "Description", "Subcategory".  Not all of those field names need to be present for the import to be successful, and fields such as "description" and "memo" mean the same thing.  The currency type and date format are assumed to be whatever has been set as the defaults.

To import:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    fin import <filename>

    fin import mybankstatement.csv
#+END_SRC

The filename should have a /.csv/ extension.

In case the same file is imported more than once the system attempts to avoid adding duplicate transactions.


** From Emacs org mode tables

Tables created with Emacs org mode, such as a shopping list or parts list, can also be imported.

As with CSV, the expected fields can include "Date", "Money in", "Money out", "Spent", "Spend", "Amount", "Memo", "Description" or "Subcategory".

Here's an example table:

  | Date       | Description     | Spent |
  |------------+-----------------+-------|
  | 03/05/2012 | Cheese sandwich |  1.50 |
  | 03/05/2012 | Teacup          |  2.00 |
  | 04/05/2012 | Butter          |  1.20 |

Note that if you use the "Amount" field name then a positive value means money received and a negative value indicates money spent.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    fin import mynotes.txt
#+END_SRC


** From GnuCash

To import from GnuCash first create a new account if you need one.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  fin account [account name]
#+END_SRC

Then import the *.gnucash* file.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  fin import myaccounts.gnucash
#+END_SRC

The GnuCash file will be examined and any active accounts will be listed.  You should then enter the name of the account that you wish to import.

If you subsequently need to export back to GnuCash then you can use the CSV export feature described below.


* _Exporting data_

** CSV

You can export data in CSV format for viewing in a spreadsheet or import into other systems.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    fin find "*" export myexportfilename.csv
#+END_SRC

Obviously you can use search strings to narrow down the data set.  It's also possible to specify the separator used between fields.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    fin find "*" export myexportfilename.csv separator tab

    fin find "*" export myexportfilename.csv separator ,
#+END_SRC

You can also export aggregated figures:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    fin export myexportfilename.csv monthly

    fin export myexportfilename.csv yearly
#+END_SRC

** Emacs

Data can be exported to Emacs in the form of org mode formatted tables.

To show results in tabular form add the option /style emacs/.

 When performing a search:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    fin search "*shopping*" style emacs > shopping_list.txt
#+END_SRC

Monthly:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    fin style emacs monthly > monthly.txt
#+END_SRC

Or yearly

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    fin style emacs yearly > yearly.txt
#+END_SRC


* _Date formats_

You can change the date format used in the following way:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    fin dateformat "%d/%m/%Y"

    fin dateformat "%m/%d/%Y"
#+END_SRC

Only the %d, %m and %Y fields are supported.


* _Plotting_

** Balance

You can plot monthly balance figures using the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    fin monthly <image filename>

    fin monthly balance.png transactions 100
#+END_SRC

The image which is output is in PNG format, and gnuplot needs to be installed for this to work.

Perhaps even more useful is to plot particular kinds of expenditure over time by using the search function.  For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    fin find "*groceries*" monthly groceries.png
#+END_SRC

Will output an image showing spending on groceries on a monthly basis over time. The "*" wildcards can be used to search for any description field containing a particular word.

** Spending Distribution

You can plot the overall distribution of amounts spent in the following way:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  fin distribution spending.png startyear 2007 endyear 2012 maximum 200
#+END_SRC

or for an individual year.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  fin distribution spending.png year 2012 maximum 100
#+END_SRC

Where /startyear/ and /endyear/ specify the range of years, and /maximum/ denotes the maximum amount.  If an image file is not specified then the results will be listed in CSV format, or emacs org-mode table format if you use the /style emacs/ option. You can also apply a search string to show the spending distribution for a particular type of item.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  fin distribution spending.png year 2015 maximum 100 search "*supermarket*,*groceries*"
#+END_SRC

** Transaction Volumes

The number of transactions per month can be shown as follows:

  fin volume

or plotted in a graph:

  fin volume mytransactions.png

As usual you can also apply search criteria and increase or decrease the number of months shown using the *transactions* option.

  fin volume mytransactions.png search "*supermarket*" transactions 50

** Pie Charts

Another way of looking at spending is to find out what percentage of income was spent on various things.  This can be done with the /piechart/ command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    fin piechart year 2008 search "*fuel*,*supermarket*,*car*"

    fin piechart year 2009 search "*fuel*|Petrol,*supermarket*|Food,*car*|Car repairs/insurance,*savings*"
#+END_SRC

The "|" character is used to specify an alias name corresponding to each search.  You can also export the data to a CSV or text file, which will then allow you to create pie charts using LibreOffice or similar software.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    fin piechart spending.csv year 2008 search "*fuel*,*supermarket*,*car*"

    fin piechart spending.csv month july search "*fuel*|Petrol,*supermarket*|Food,*car*|Car repairs/insurance,*savings*"
#+END_SRC

Or you can also plot to an image.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    fin piechart chart.png year 2010 search "*fuel*|Petrol,*supermarket*|Food,*car*|Car repairs/insurance,*savings*"
#+END_SRC

A subtlety here is that you can combine searches into a single category using the "+" sign.  For example, to merge "car" and "fuel" into a single category:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    fin piechart chart.png year 2010 search "*car*+*fuel*|Total Car,*supermarket*|Food,*savings*"
#+END_SRC


* _Geolocation_

Although it's not typical at the time of writing it is expected that embedded devices such as phones will eventually become a replacement for conventional wallets and physical cash, so it might also be useful to be able to log the locations of transactions.  Optionally, a geolocation can be associated with each transaction.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    fin spend 9.99 on book long:1.2 lat:41.6 alt:52.1
#+END_SRC

This information can subsequently be exported as part of a search:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    fin find "*" kml <filename>

    fin find "*" year 2011 kml <filename>
#+END_SRC


* _Security_

Ordinarily the "data at rest" within the ~/.fin directory is not encrypted.  Since financial data may often be confidential there is an easy way to encrypt the data when you're not using it.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    fin lock
#+END_SRC

You will be prompted to enter a password, then the files will be encrypted.  The next time you run fin you will then be prompted for the password.
